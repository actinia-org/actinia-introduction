# actinia-introduction

Introduction to actinia cloud geoprocessing (https://actinia.mundialis.de/) - see tutorial at https://mundialis.github.io/actinia-introduction/

This workshop is a fork of https://neteler.gitlab.io/actinia-introduction. The initial workshop has a more detailed chapter about ace - the actinia command execution. This workshop focuses more on the "bare" HTTP API from actinia.

## How to build locally

First (and only once):

```
pip install mkdocs setuptools
```

Then (everytime you want the build to run):

```
mkdocs build
```

Open `site/index.html` in your favourite browser to see the output.
